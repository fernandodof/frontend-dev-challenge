# `Jaya front-end challenge`

This is my version of the challenge from the template folder

This project has an express server and I created a webpack build to buldle and complile the sass and js files.

To run the project 

- cd into the challenge folder
- `npm i` to install the dependencies 
- `npm start` to start the project
- That's it, now open your broswer on http://localhost:3000
